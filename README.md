## Using Statistics In Marketing Analytics
#### By Kevin Eddy
For this project I'm using the dataset found in the following link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/111Qu0KWR5ILzmmB2TVZTwesUI-zkNW7m/edit#gid=1497916650

In today's competitive advertising landscape, it is essential to regularly analyze campaign data to gain insights into the performance of different marketing strategies. This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of Meta and AdWords campaign data from 2019 to identify trends, craft and test hypotheses, and provide recommendations for improving future campaigns.

The analysis will involve the following steps:

 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights into the overall performance of the campaigns, such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and cost per conversion. Identify any significant trends or patterns in the data.
 - Hypothesis Testing: Formulate hypotheses based on the observations from EDA and test them using statistical methods. This will help to determine the impact of different campaign variables on performance.
 - Insight Generation: Interpret the results of the hypothesis tests and other analyses to generate actionable insights for improving future campaigns.
 - Recommendations: Develop recommendations for improving the next round of campaigns based on the insights gained from the analysis. This may include suggestions for optimizing ad copy, targeting, bidding strategies, and landing pages.
 
The project will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the Meta and AdWords campaigns conducted in 2019. The findings will help to improve the efficiency of future campaigns, leading to increased conversions and a higher return on investment (ROI). The recommendations provided in the project will be actionable and tailored to the specific needs of the business.

To make this analysis a bit easier follow, I have broken it into 4 parts:
 - Getting to Know the Data
 - Understanding Your Data Samples
 - Testing Your Hypothesis
 - Choosing and Executing a Model
 - Findings and Recommendation
